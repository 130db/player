Player
======

Blackfire Player is a powerful Web Crawling and Web Scraper library for PHP. It
provides a nice API to **crawl HTTP services** and **extract data** from the
HTML/XML/JSON responses.

Some Blackfire Player uses cases:

* Crawl your website/API and check expectations -- aka Acceptance Tests;

* Scrape your website/API and extract values;

* Use Blackfire Player in your tests (PHPUnit, Behat, Codeception, ...);

* Test your code behavior from the outside thanks to the native Blackfire
  integration -- aka *Unit Tests from the HTTP layer* (tm).
